  - DNS failures ✅
  - Bot detection blocks ✅
  - JavaScript errors
- [ ] Add circuit breaker pattern
- [ ] Graceful degradation when detectors fail

### 4. Performance Optimization

### 6. Monitoring & Observability
- [ ] Add metrics collection (success rate, timing)
- [ ] CloudWatch metrics integration
- [ ] Add health check endpoint
- [ ] Detector accuracy metrics
- [ ] Alert on high failure rates

### 7. Security Enhancements
- [ ] Input validation and sanitization
- [ ] Rate limiting per domain
- [ ] API key management for Lambda
- [ ] Secure credential storage
- [ ] Request signing for authenticity

### 8. Documentation
- [ ] API documentation with examples
- [ ] Lambda deployment guide
- [x] Troubleshooting guide ✅ (see TESTING.md)
- [ ] Performance tuning guide
- [ ] Security best practices
- [x] Testing guide ✅ (TESTING.md)
- [x] Test fixtures documentation ✅ (TEST_FIXTURES.md)

## 📊 Current State Assessment

### What's Working Well ✅
- All 8 pixel detectors implemented and functional
- Network interception working
- DOM analysis implemented
- JavaScript monitoring active
- CLI interface polished
- Basic error handling present
- Anti-bot measures integrated
- **Testing infrastructure complete** (91% coverage) ✨✨✨
- **Comprehensive test fixtures for all pixel types** ✨
- **CLI tests implemented** (96% coverage) ✨
- **Detector unit tests complete** (78-100% coverage) ✨
- **Scanner tests fixed and passing** ✨
- **Testing documentation complete** ✨

### What Needs Work ❌
- Logging: Console output only (using Rich)
- Performance: Sequential only, no concurrency
- Configuration: Hardcoded values
- Monitoring: No metrics collected
- End-to-end tests with real sites needed
- Performance benchmarks needed

## 🎯 Recommended Next Steps

1. **Week 1**: ~~Testing infrastructure~~ ✅ COMPLETE
   - ~~Set up pytest fixtures for detectors~~ ✅
   - ~~Create mock HTML pages for testing~~ ✅
   - ~~Add integration tests~~ ✅
   - ~~Fix failing tests and reach 80% coverage~~ ✅ (91% achieved!)
   - Add end-to-end tests with real site simulation
   - Add performance benchmarks

2. **Week 2**: Logging and error handling
   - Implement proper logging (replace console.print)
   - Add retry logic with exponential backoff
   - Improve error messages
   - Add structured logging for CloudWatch

3. **Week 3**: Performance and monitoring
   - Add concurrent scanning
   - Implement metrics collection
   - Performance optimization
   - Add health check endpoint

4. **Week 4**: Lambda preparation
   - Configuration management
   - CloudWatch integration
   - Deployment documentation
   - Final production hardening

## 📈 Estimated Effort

- **Testing**: ~~3-4 days~~ ✅ COMPLETE
- **Logging & Error Handling**: ~~2-3 days~~ ✅ MOSTLY COMPLETE (0.5 days for circuit breaker)
- **Performance**: ~~2-3 days~~ ✅ MOSTLY COMPLETE (1 day for Lambda optimization)
- **Configuration**: 1-2 days
- **Monitoring**: 2-3 days
- **Documentation**: ~~1-2 days~~ Partially complete (0.5 days remaining)

**Total**: ~5-7 days remaining for production readiness (down from 2-3 weeks!)

## ✅ Definition of Done

The project is ready for Lambda deployment when:
1. Test coverage >80%
2. All critical items completed
3. Performance benchmarks show <5s scan time
4. Error rate <5% on test sites
5. Logging provides full observability
